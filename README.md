## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** pipeline to extract insights from unstructured job descriptions. By leveraging linguistic lemmatization and unsupervised learning, the tool identifies key market trends, required technical skills, and sector-specific clusters.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Core NLP:** `Stanza` (Stanford NLP) for high-accuracy French lemmatization.
- **Machine Learning:** `Scikit-learn` for **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **K-Means Clustering**.
- **Data Engineering:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Regex` for advanced text cleaning.
- **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `WordCloud`.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Linguistic Pipeline:** Automated cleaning and tokenization of raw text data.
- **Skill Extraction:** Statistical identification of **Hard Skills** (Python, R, SQL, etc.) and **Soft Skills**.
- **Unsupervised Clustering:** Segmenting job offers into thematic clusters using the **K-Means** algorithm.
- **Visual Insights:** Generation of WordClouds and frequency charts to summarize market demand.

## 📊 How to view the results?
The data analysis, including all charts and tables (WordClouds, Skills distribution, Clustering plots), is available directly in the `.ipynb` file in this repository.
